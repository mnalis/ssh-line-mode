Description: local line-by-line editing mode for ssh client
 This is wrapper around ssh(1) which allows it to do local line editing
 before sending it to remote host (also known by names such as telnet line mode,
 line-by-line, line mode, line buffered mode, canonical mode, cooked mode,
 RFC 1184).
 It is inspired by line-by-line editing mode in telnet(1) of old.
 Intended for use in high latency environments (especially when mixed
 with packet loss and/or low-bandwidth)
